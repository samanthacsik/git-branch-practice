# A quick crash course in branching

Branches confuse the heck out of me, mostly because I haven't had a *real* reason to use them. Brendan helped walk me through a practice session to start familiarizing myself with the general workflow. I'm documenting my notes here for future reference.

### Steps (at least the steps we took in this practice example):

1. Sam created a GitHub Repository called [git-branch-practice](https://github.com/samanthacsik/git-branch-practice) and invited Brendan as a collaborator. Brendan cloned the repo to his computer.
2. Sam & Brendan each create their own branches on their computers (**NOTE:** Brendan recommends naming branches using the following convention: `githubUserName/featureName`

`$ git checkout -b samanthacsik/feature1`

3. Sam and Brendan each create a file(s) on their local machines on their respective branches.
